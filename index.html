                        <strong>1972: College drop-out</strong> - The young Jobs graduated from his high school and joined the course at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. 
                        During the time, Jobs had no idea on what he wanted to do with his life, and he was spending all of the money his parents had saved their entire life, 
                        so he decided to drop the course after only 1 semester, mainly because he could not afford the course.

                        <strong>1972: Jobs' first job</strong> - Jobs’ first job was with Hewlett-Packard, as a summer employee. He then took a job as a technician at Atari, 
                        which was a famous video game manufacturer. He was given a job to create circuit board for the game, “Breakout”, and he collaborated with Steve Wozniak, 
                        who was later the co-founder of the Apple Company.

                        <strong>1974: Jobs became a buddhist</strong> - Jobs was sparked with the interest of philosophy during his days at Reed College. At the same year he 
                        took on his first job at Atari, he traveled to Neem Karoli Baba, India with Dan Kottke. They went in search of spiritual enlightenment. He came back as 
                        a Buddhist, with his head shaved and he was wearing traditional Indian clothing.

                        <strong>1976: Apple computer is born</strong> - Many believed Jobs was inspired by Atari’s founder Nolan Bushnell, and the inspiration got him 
                        started Apple Computer. In 1976, at the age of 21 years old, Steve Jobs founded Apple with his summer job’s co-worker at HP, Steve Wozniak, making
                        them the first and second Apple employee. The company was later funded by an angel investor, Armas Clifford Markkula, who brought in USD $250,000.

                        <strong>1983: Sugared water?</strong> - An uprising year for Apple. The company hired Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO. 
                        Later, Jobs persuaded John Sculley, who was the CEO of Pepsi-Cola, to serve as Apple’s CEO, with a very famous question: <em>“Do you want to sell 
                        sugared water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?”</em>

                        <strong>1984: Jobs introduced the macintosh</strong> - The legend of Jobs’ innovation had just started. Jobs introduced the Macintosh to the 
                        world, and it became the first commercially successful small computer with a GUI (Graphical User Interface). The Mac’s development was later 
                        taken over by Jobs.

                        <strong>1985: Jobs gets fired from Apple</strong> - A turning year for Apple and Steve Jobs. Following the internal power struggle and 
                        announcement of significant layoffs due to the pessimistic sales, Sculley took off Jobs from being the head of the Macintosh division, and 
                        later Jobs was fired by his own founded company, Apple. Nevertheless he described that the firing was the best thing happened to his life, 
                        noting that <em>“The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It 
                        freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”</em>

                        <strong>1985: Jobs founded NeXT</strong> - The innovation journey of Jobs didn’t end here. He founded another computer company named 
                        NeXT Computer, which produced highly advanced computer, but was ignored by market with “cost-prohibitive” as the primary reason. Like 
                        any other Apple product, Jobs ran the NeXT with the obsession for aesthetic perfection, but only 50,000 units of the machines were sold.
                        Due to the production constraint, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel.

                        <strong>1986: Jobs founded Pixar</strong> - Jobs purchased a Graphics Group with the price of $10 million, which is widely known 
                        as Pixar today. The company was initially producing the high-end graphic hardware, but as the business didn’t go well, the company then 
                        contracted with Disney to produce a number of computer-animated films, and Toy Story 1 was one of its notable successes.

                        <strong>1996: Jobs re-joined Apple</strong> - Apple, having experienced a series of business and innovation failure, bought NeXT to 
                        bring back Jobs to the company. Jobs was then named as the interim chief executive. After the return of the Jobs, he terminated a number 
                        of projects which he thought were useless to the company’s business.

                        to be true. Jobs was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his pancreas, which doctor advised him to get his affairs in order, and told him 
                        that he should expect to live no longer than 3-6 months. For him, it means to say goodbye.

                        would take the entire August off to take care of his health, and expects to recover from the pancreatic cancer. He planned to return 
                        to work in September. Tim Cook (current Apple CEO), head of worldwide sales and operation at that time, took over Apple for the first 
                        time.

                        The speech was split into 3 main topics, with the first topic focused on his earlier life, second topic focused on his leaving from 
                        Apple and founding of NeXT, and the currently infamous third part – the death.

                                Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with 
                                the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most 
                                important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

                        <strong>2007: Jobs introduced the iPhone</strong> - 6 months after telling George Bodenheimer of ESPN that the company’s new 
                        phone sucks, Jobs unveiled the plan of entering the mobile market with his new and revolutionary iDevice, named iPhone, which 
                        later not only dominated the U.S. market, but also changed the way people using the mobile phone, thus forcing mobile giants like 
                        Nokia to innovate at its best.

                        in the previous week he had learned that his health-related issues are more complex than he originally thought, thus announced 
                        a six-month leave until the end of June 2009 to allow him to focus on his health. Tim Cook, who had previously acted as CEO 
                        during Jobs’ absence in 2004, became acting CEO of Apple, with Jobs still involved with "major strategic decisions." In April 2009, 
                        Jobs underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee. Jobs’ prognosis 
                        was "excellent".

                        step to introduce his last revolutionary product to the world – iPad. Once again Steve Jobs shocked the world by the device 
                        which can’t even be categorized into either computer or smartphone category, but its surprising success has once again proved 
                        the visionary power of the Jobs.

                        delegated most of the speeches to different Apple’s key employees, which pretty much hinted his falling health.

                        as Apple’s CEO“. He named Tim Cook as his successor, and thanked the Apple’s employees for working with him these years.
